   "description": "In this video, Dr. Jim Harter discusses the Q12 survey question “In the last six months, someone at work has talked to me about my progress.” Each employee excels in at least one area. Too often, managers prefer to focus on areas that need improvement instead of areas of excellence. Gallup’s research shows that greater gains are made by building on talent, as opposed to trying to improve weaknesses. When both the manager and the employee identify a task at which the employee truly excels, they can work together to create a development plan that supports the individual’s full learning potential, positioning the employee to make his or her greatest contribution to the organization.

And you can never give too much recognition if it is honest and deserved.",

Matching a person to the right job, or a job to the right person, is one of the most complicated responsibilities any manager will face. As a consequence, no other element of managing has as much depth as the one measured by the Q12 survey question “At work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.”",

   "description": "In this video, Dr. Jim Harter discusses one of the most powerful questions for measuring engagement: “I know what is expected of me at work.” Groups that have 1 scores on this item are more productive, more profitable, even more creative. Substantial gains on the first element alone often correlate with productivity gains of 5-10%, thousands more happy customers, and 10-20% fewer on-the-job accidents. The greatest pitfall of this element is that managers assume the simplicity of the statement means the issue requires only a basic solution: “If people don’t know what’s expected, I’ll just tell them.” ",

The series also explores how the aging of the baby boomer generation will affect politics and well-being. Despite U.S. baby boomers' considerable years of experience in the workforce, they are no more likely than younger generations to say that they are able to use their strengths to do what they do best throughout the day. Overall, working baby boomers say they use their strengths to do what they do best an average of 6.9 hours a day, on par with 6.8 hours for Generation Xers and 6.7 hours for millennials.",

MLH also provided details about its balance sheet to Gallup. Gallup found that 49% of employees left the hospital within their first year of employment, and that overall, 22% of employees left MLH for other organizations. Further, MLH reported 25% annual turnover among nurses — an essential component of the hospital’s care staff. Most egregiously, MLH was operating at a loss; its operating margin was -0.2%. Gallup also conducted its own research-based employee engagement assessment, the Q12, and found that MLH’s engagement was dismally 3 compared with other organizations in Gallup’s worldwide engagement database.

Referencing her experiences from previous roles in the private sector, Paula quickly identified a strengths-based approach to organizational development as a potential solution to some of the challenges plaguing the government. After all, from a management perspective, “running lean” meant the City staff must know what it does best and stick to that, outsourcing the rest — certainly a version of a strengths-based approach.",
